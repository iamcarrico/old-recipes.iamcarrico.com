  - amount: 0.5
    unit: cup
    ingredient: Chopped fresh cilantro
directions:
  - Add the quinoa, water, and salt to a medium sized pot. Bring to a boil over medium heat. When it has reached a boil, cover and cook for 20-25 minutes, or until the quinoa is soft and fluffy.
  - Set the quinoa aside to cool.
  - When it has cooled, add the lime juice, lime zest, and 1/4 cup chopped cilantro to the rice and stir to evenly distribute the ingredients. Taste, and add more lime or cilantro as needed.
  - Dry off both chicken breasts thoroughly with paper towels, and season both sides of each breast using the 2 teaspoons of salt.
  - In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon coconut oil or ghee over medium-high heat until the oil is very hot.
  - Add the chicken breasts to the hot skillet, and cook for about 4 minutes on each side. Both sides should have a pretty brown sear to them.
  - When the chicken breasts are cooked all the way through, remove them to a cutting board to cool. Once they've cooled, cut the chicken into small chunks, about 1/2 square inch each.
  - If you're going to add bacon to your salad, cook 2 slices of bacon as you normally would, until it is crispy enough to crumble. Reserve 1 tablespoon of bacon fat for the sweet potatoes.
  - Cut up the sweet potato into tiny chunks, about 1/2 square inch each.
  - Heat 1 tablespoon of bacon fat (or, if you didn't use bacon, coconut oil) in your large skillet over medium heat.
  - When the oil is hot, add the sweet potato cubes. Sear the potatoes on all sides, stirring every 3-5 minutes.
  - When the potatoes have all browned on the outside, turn the heat down to medium-low, cover the skillet with a lid, and cook the sweet potatoes until they can be easily pierced with a fork. Set aside to cool.
  - When all ingredients have cooled, you can begin to assemble your burrito bowl salads. Add 1 tablespoon of plain Greek yogurt to the bottom of each pint-sized wide mouth mason jar.
  - Top with about 2 tablespoons of sweet potato cubes.
  - On top of the sweet potatoes, add 3-4 tablespoons of the cilantro lime quinoa.
  - Layer 1-2 tablespoons of cheese over the quinoa, a little less than half a piece of bacon over the cheese, and a layer of chicken over the bacon. (To make this vegetarian, substitute 1 can of rinsed beans for the chicken and bacon and add a layer of beans here.)
  - Fill the remaining space in the mason jar with lettuce, and sprinkle some additional chopped cilantro on top before screwing on the lid.

This recipe from [Strictly Delicious](http://www.strictlydelicious.com/) has been one of my favorites. I use a form of the sweet potatoes every morning as part of my breakfast— because it is so easy to make a large amount and use during the week. That being said, I have made a few changes of my own.

First off, I don't use the cilantro at all. Because cilantro is evil— and ruins everything it touches. I also don't follow the directions found here for the chicken— I use my [taco chicken recipe](/recipies/taco-chicken/).
